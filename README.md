[Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) infrastructure written in [Python](https://python.org/).

RUV is a library to quantify the value of forecast information for decision-making using the Relative Utility Value metric. 
This reference implementation is reasonably computationally efficient and parallelises timesteps over available CPU cores. 
The software includes a small library of standard decision rules, utility functions, damage functions, and economic models. 
The scope is intentionally narrow and does not include any figure generation, data loading and saving, other metrics, or analysis functionality.

## Publications

The method and software package are introduced in detail in the following publications. We suggest reading these to understand the context and motivation for the software.

*Laugesen, R., Thyer, M., McInerney, D., and Kavetski, D.: Flexible forecast value metric suitable for a wide range of decisions: application using probabilistic subseasonal streamflow forecasts, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 873â€“893, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-873-2023, 2023.*

*Laugesen, R., Thyer, M., McInerney, D., Kavetski, D. (2024). Software to quantify the value of forecasts for decision-making: sensitivity to damages case study. Manuscript submitted for publication in Environmental Modelling & Software.*

## Installation

The package requires Python (>=3.8) and a few dependencies. The dependencies are defined in the (pyproject.toml) file for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) dependency management.

Install the required dependencies using Poetry and then run the unit tests with the following commands:

    poetry install

    poetry shell

    poetry run pytest

## Example

The package includes a set of examples which loosely correspond with figures in the publications noted above. 

These are all implemented as Jupyter notebooks in the `examples` directory.
