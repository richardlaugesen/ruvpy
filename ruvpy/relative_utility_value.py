# main entry function for RUV calculation
def relative_utility_value(obs: np.ndarray, fcsts: np.ndarray, refs: np.ndarray, decision_context: dict, parallel_nodes: int=4) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate the Relative Utility Value (RUV) for a set of observations, forecasts, and references using
    specified decision-context.

    This entry function to RUVPY calculates RUV by evaluating the utility of forecasts through a simulation of decision-making under uncertainty.
    RUV quantifies the value of forecasts relative to a reference scenario (e.g., climatology) and is often applied in settings such as
    streamflow forecasting or weather forecasting, where decisions are made based on forecast probabilities.
    It is typically used with probabilistic forecasts but can also handle deterministic forecasts (single ensemble member for fcsts and refs).

    The RUV method and RUVPY software package are introduced in detail in the following publications. We suggest reading these to understand the context and motivation for the software.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : np.ndarray
        1D array of observed values, representing the actual outcomes.
    fcsts : np.ndarray
        2D array of forecast values, where each column is an ensemble member and each row corresponds to a forecast at a given time.
    refs : np.ndarray
        2D array of reference values (e.g., climatology ensemble), where each column is an ensemble member and each row corresponds to a time period.
        If None, a reference climatology will be generated based on the observations, reproduces the observed frequency of events as in REV.
    decision_context : dict
        Dictionary defining the decision-context. The dictionary must contain:
        - 'decision_thresholds': A 1D array specifying thresholds used to define decisions based on forecast values.
        - 'decision_rule': A list with the decision-making function as the first element, and its parameters as the second.
        - 'damage_function': A list with the damage function method as the first element, and its parameters as the second.
        - 'utility_function': A list with the utility function method as the first element, and its parameters as the second.
        - 'economic_model': A list with the economic model function, its analytical spend function, and a list of parameter values (e.g. alpha).
    parallel_nodes : int, optional
        The number of parallel processes used for computation. Defaults to 4.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary containing the calculated Relative Utility Value (RUV) results for the given forecasts.
        The dictionary includes:
        - 'ruv': A 2D array of RUV values for each economic model parameter.
        - 'economic_model_params': The economic model parameters used in the calculation for convenience.
        - 'avg_fcst_ex_post', 'avg_ref_ex_post', 'avg_obs_ex_post': Average ex post results for forecasts, references, and observations, respectively.
        - 'fcst_spends', 'ref_spends', 'obs_spends': Spending values for forecasts, references, and observations.
        - 'fcst_ex_ante', 'ref_ex_ante', 'obs_ex_ante': Ex ante (expected) results for forecasts, references, and observations.
        - 'fcst_ex_post', 'ref_ex_post', 'obs_ex_post': Ex post (actual) results for forecasts, references, and observations.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If inputs contain missing values, or if thresholds are violated (e.g., forecast or observation values are less than the smallest decision threshold).
        Also raised if the lengths of `obs`, `fcsts`, and `refs` do not match.

    Examples
    --------
    Example decision context:

        decision_context = {
            'utility_function': [cara, {'A': 0.3}],
            'decision_rule': [optimise_over_forecast_distribution, None],
            'decision_thresholds': np.array([0, 5, 15, 25]),
            'economic_model': [cost_loss, cost_loss_analytical_spend, np.array([0.1, 0.5, 0.9])],
            'damage_function': [logistic, {'k': 0.2, 'A': 1, 'threshold': 20}]
        }

    Complete examples reproducing figures from related research are included as Jupyter notebooks in the *examples* directory.
