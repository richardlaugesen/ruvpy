"""Economic models representing the net outcome of damages and user spending.

These functions provide a net economic outcome from user spending ``spend`` and
the damages due to the state of the world ``values`` and the ``damage_function``.
An economic model will typically be parameterised (single parameter only for
current RUVPY version).

An additional function can be provided for each economic model to calculate
the optimal spend amount for deterministic inputs. This significantly speeds
up the calculation of RUV by avoiding the numerical optimisation required
with ensemble inputs.
